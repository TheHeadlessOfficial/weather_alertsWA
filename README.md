## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_waalerts` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_waalerts`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/weather/Weatherapi/alerts/` and open with a text editor the file `alerts.py`, go to row 16 and 17 and type your latitude and your longitude, go to row 18 and type your city name, go to row 19 and write your APPID.<br>
If you don't know how to get your APPID, follow this video instructions: [APPID guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgRy3O12DKo&list=PLTjXqPpTV2L84EMOTS0EKjUvGxnNDtVM3&index=23)<br>
In the `font` folder, you can find some fonts you need.<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky weather as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_waalerts` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_waalerts` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
